# Update history

- To limit the necessary modifications to our code that allows uninterrupted processing of new datasets, we updated the scripts SVD1-17. In all tested cases, it was now sufficient to only adopt the first part of the script "SVD_global_parameter.R" to the new datasets and the working directory in "SVD_0000000_main_Run_pipeline.R". Instructions how to prepare new datasets for the pipeline can be found in the uploaded PDF "Manual_for_SVD1-17.pdf". For example, if treatment condition- or treated entity-related colors are not defined in the file "SVD_colors.R", the script will automatically assign colors instead of throwing an exception.
