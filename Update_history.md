# Update history
2024 November 23
- To limit the necessary modifications to our code that allows uninterrupted processing of new datasets, we updated the scripts SVD1-17. In all tested cases, it was now sufficient to adopt the first part of the scripts "SVD_global_parameter.R" to the new datasets and "SVD_0000000_main_Run_pipeline.R". Instructions how to prepare new datasets for the pipeline can be found in the uploaded PDF "Manual_for_SVD1-17.pdf".
