# Update history

- To limit the necessary modifications to our code that allows uninterrupted processing of new datasets, we updated the scripts SVD1-17. In all tested cases, it was now sufficient to only adopt the first part of the script "SVD_global_parameter.R" to the new datasets and the working directory in "SVD_0000000_main_Run_pipeline.R". The PDF "Manual_for_SVD1-17.pdf" describes how to prepare new datasets for the pipeline.
